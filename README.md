# Material 3 Samples — design artifacts

Importable sticker-sheet for **`org.jetbrains.compose.material3:material3`**, rendered from the committed
`@Preview` catalog in [`yschimke/m3-catalog`](https://github.com/yschimke/m3-catalog). This branch is a
**generated delivery artifact** — browse it in the page below, or pull it into
Figma / Stitch / Claude Design.

## 🔎 Browse the catalog

**[▶ Open the rendered catalog (htmlpreview)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yschimke/m3-catalog/blob/design-artifacts/m3-samples/index.html)**

A self-contained gallery — one card per component with its rendered PNG,
dimensions, accessibility greenlines, and a link to an editable SVG wireframe.

## 🔬 Compare SVG vs PNG

**[▶ Open the SVG↔PNG comparison (htmlpreview)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yschimke/m3-catalog/blob/design-artifacts/m3-samples/compare.html)**

Every component on one row: its editable **figma-svg** re-rasterized by the
browser beside the rendered **PNG** it is measured against — the design vector on
the left, the render on the right, as everywhere else the two are shown together
— plus a live **structural-similarity (SSIM)** match
score — so you can eyeball vector fidelity across the whole system at once and
spot which stickers drift. The score is pre-blurred and downscaled, so a
half-pixel rasterizer offset doesn't read as a mismatch.

## ↔ Compare across systems

**[▶ Open the Material 3 Samples ↔ m3-catalog matches (htmlpreview)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yschimke/m3-catalog/blob/design-artifacts/m3-samples/matches.html)**

Every component paired with its counterpart in **m3-catalog**, side by side — the
authored `parallel` mapping in the catalog spec, rendered as a cross-system contact sheet. Both
sides are static thumbnails — this branch's baked render on the left, the m3-catalog
render baked from its own `design-artifacts/m3-catalog` branch on the right — and each
links to the live preview server on click.

## 🎛 Customise live

**[▶ Open this catalog in the live preview server](https://preview.coo.ee/m3-samples/)**

The same rendered components, served live by `compose-preview serve --catalogs m3-samples` —
open one, then change the theme, locale, font scale, or device and watch it
re-render. Every entry in `catalog.json` carries a per-variant `livePreview`
deep link to its exact preview on the same server, so browsing this branch and
customising the live render are two ends of one workflow.

## What's in this branch

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Self-contained gallery — [open via htmlpreview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yschimke/m3-catalog/blob/design-artifacts/m3-samples/index.html) |
| `compare.html` | SVG↔PNG comparison with a live structural-similarity score — [open via htmlpreview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yschimke/m3-catalog/blob/design-artifacts/m3-samples/compare.html) |

| `catalog.json` | Machine-readable catalog (`design-parity-catalog/v1`): components, variants, design tokens, greenlines, and per-variant `livePreview` deep links |
| `images/` | Rendered PNGs — the source of truth for each variant |
| `wireframes/` | One editable SVG per component (layout-inspector tree → token-styled shapes) |

## Using it

- **Figma / Stitch / Claude Design** — import `catalog.json` + `images/` as a sticker sheet.
- **Browse** — open `index.html` through htmlpreview (link above), or clone the branch and open it locally.
- **Customise** — open the [live preview server](https://preview.coo.ee/m3-samples/) (or any image's `livePreview` link in `catalog.json`) to re-render a component under different themes / locales / devices.
- **Adopt structure** — the `wireframes/*.svg` are plain vector files; drop one into any editor to start from the real layout instead of tracing a screenshot.

## Provenance

Generated by the [`Design Artifacts`](https://github.com/yschimke/m3-catalog/actions/workflows/design-artifacts.yml)
workflow: `compose-preview bundle pack` → catalog-export driver → force-push to
this branch. The render is the source of truth.

> ⚠️ **This branch is regenerated (force-pushed) from `main`** — weekly and after
> catalog/renderer changes. Don't commit work here by hand; it will be
> overwritten on the next run.
